/// \mainpage RF22 library for Arduino
///
/// \par END OF LIFE NOTICE
///
/// This RF22 library has now been superceded by the RadioHead 
/// library http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead
/// RadioHead and its RH_RF22 driver provides all the features supported by RF22, and much more
/// besides, including Reliable Datagrams, Addressing, Routing and Meshes. All the platforms that
/// RF22 supported are also supported by RadioHead.
///
/// This library will no longer be maintained or updated, but we will continue to publish
/// it for the benefit of the the community, and you may continue to use it within the terms of
/// the license. Nevertheless we recommend upgrading to RadioHead where
/// possible.
///
/// This is the Arduino RF22 library.
/// It provides an object-oriented interface for sending and receiving data messages with Hope-RF
/// RF22B based radio modules, and compatible chips and modules, 
/// including the RFM22B transceiver module such as 
/// this bare module: http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10153
/// and this shield: http://www.sparkfun.com/products/11018
///
/// RF22 also supports some of the features of ZigBee and XBee, 
/// (such as mesh routing and automatic route discovery), 
/// but with a much less complicated system and less expensive radios.
///
/// The Hope-RF (http://www.hoperf.com) RFM22B (http://www.hoperf.com/rf_fsk/fsk/RFM22B.htm) 
/// is a low-cost ISM transceiver module. It supports FSK, GFSK, OOK over a wide 
/// range of frequencies and programmable data rates.
/// Manual can be found at https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Wireless/General/RFM22.PDF
///
/// This library provides functions for sending and receiving messages of up to 255 octets on any 
/// frequency supported by the RF22B, in a range of predefined data rates and frequency deviations. 
/// Frequency can be set with 312Hz precision to any frequency from 240.0MHz to 960.0MHz.
///
/// Up to 3 RF22B modules can be connected to an Arduino, permitting the construction of translators
/// and frequency changers, etc.
///
/// This library provides classes for 
/// - RF22: unaddressed, unreliable messages
/// - RF22Datagram: addressed, unreliable messages
/// - RF22ReliableDatagram: addressed, reliable, retransmitted, acknowledged messages.
/// - RF22Router: multi hop delivery from source node to destination node via 0 or more intermediate nodes
/// - RF22Mesh: multi hop delivery with automatic route discovery and rediscovery.
///
/// The following modulation types are suppported with a range of modem configurations for 
/// common data rates and frequency deviations:
/// - GFSK Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying
/// - FSK Frequency Shift Keying
/// - OOK On-Off Keying
///
/// Support for other RF22B features such as on-chip temperature measurement, analog-digital 
/// converter, transmitter power control etc is also provided.
///
/// The latest version of this documentation can be downloaded from 
/// http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RF22
///
/// Example Arduino programs are included to show the main modes of use.
///
/// The version of the package that this documentation refers to can be downloaded 
/// from http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RF22/RF22-1.40.zip
/// You can find the latest version at http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RF22
///
/// You can also find online help and disussion at 
/// http://groups.google.com/group/rf22-arduino
/// Please use that group for all questions and discussions on this topic. 
/// Do not contact the author directly, unless it is to discuss commercial licensing.
/// Before asking a question or reporting a bug, please read http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
///
/// Tested on Arduino Diecimila and Mega with arduino-0021 
/// on OpenSuSE 11.1 and avr-libc-1.6.1-1.15,
/// cross-avr-binutils-2.19-9.1, cross-avr-gcc-4.1.3_20080612-26.5.
/// With HopeRF RFM22 modules that appear to have RF22B chips on board:
///    - Device Type Code = 0x08 (RX/TRX)
///    - Version Code = 0x06
/// Works on Duo. Works with Sparkfun RFM22 Wireless shields.
/// Works with Arduino 1.0 to at least 1.0.4
///
/// \par Packet Format
///
/// All messages sent and received by this RF22 library must conform to this packet format:
///
/// - 8 nibbles (4 octets) PREAMBLE
/// - 2 octets SYNC 0x2d, 0xd4
/// - 4 octets HEADER: (TO, FROM, ID, FLAGS)
/// - 1 octet LENGTH (0 to 255), number of octets in DATA
/// - 0 to 255 octets DATA
/// - 2 octets CRC computed with CRC16(IBM), computed on HEADER, LENGTH and DATA
///
/// For technical reasons, the message format is not compatible with the 
/// 'HopeRF Radio Transceiver Message Library for Arduino' http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/HopeRF from the same author. Nor is it compatible with 
/// 'Virtual Wire' http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/VirtualWire.pdf also from the same author.
///
/// \par Connecting RFM-22 to Arduino
///
/// If you have the Sparkfun RFM22 Shield (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11018)
/// the connections described below are done for you on the shield, no changes required, 
/// just add headers and plug it in to an Arduino (but not and Arduino Mega, see below)
///
/// The physical connection between the RF22B and the Arduino require 3.3V, the 3 x SPI pins (SCK, SDI, SDO), 
/// a Slave Select pin and an interrupt pin.
/// Note also that on the RFF22B, it is required to control the TX_ANT and X_ANT pins of the RFM22 in order to enable the
/// antenna connection. The RF22 library is configured so that GPIO0 and GPIO1 outputs can control TX_ANT and RX_ANT input pins
/// automatically. You must connect GPIO0 to TX_ANT and GPIO1 to RX_ANT for this automatic antenna switching to occur.
///
/// If you are using the Sparkfun RF22 shield, it will work with any 5V arduino without modification.
/// Connect the RFM-22 module to most Arduino's like this (Caution, Arduino Mega has different pins for SPI, 
/// see below):
/// \code

///
/// and you can then use the default constructor RF22(). 
/// You can override the default settings for the SS pin and the interrupt 
/// in the RF22 constructor if you wish to connect the slave select SS to other than the normal one for your 
/// Arduino (D10 for Diecimila, Uno etc and D53 for Mega)
/// or the interrupt request to other than pin D2 (Caution, different processors have different constraints as to the 
/// pins available for interrupts).
///
/// It is possible to have 2 radios connected to one Arduino, provided each radio has its own 
/// SS and interrupt line (SCK, SDI and SDO are common to both radios)
///
/// Caution: on some Arduinos such as the Mega 2560, if you set the slave select pin to be other than the usual SS 
/// pin (D53 on  Mega 2560), you may need to set the usual SS pin to be an output to force the Arduino into SPI 
/// master mode.
///
/// Caution: Power supply requirements of the RF22 module may be relevant in some circumstances: 
/// RF22 modules are capable of pulling 80mA+ at full power, where Arduino's 3.3V line can
/// give 50mA. You may need to make provision for alternate power supply for
/// the RF22, especially if you wish to use full transmit power, and/or you have
/// other shields demanding power. Inadequate power for the RF22 is reported to cause symptoms such as:
/// - reset's/bootups terminate with "init failed" messages
/// -random termination of communication after 5-30 packets sent/received
/// -"fake ok" state, where initialization passes fluently, but communication doesn't happen
/// -shields hang Arduino boards, especially during the flashing
///
/// Caution: some RF22 breakout boards (such as the HAB-RFM22B-BOA  HAB-RFM22B-BO) reportedly 
/// have the TX_ANT and RX_ANT pre-connected to GPIO0 and GPIO1 round the wrong way. You can work with this
/// if you edit RF22.cpp and change the code that does spiWrite(RF22_REG_0B_GPIO_CONFIGURATION0, 0x12). 
/// See the comments there
///
/// Caution: If you are using a bare RF22 module without IO level shifters, you may have difficulty connecting
/// to a 5V arduino. The RF22 module is 3.3V and its IO pins are 3.3V not 5V. Some Arduinos (Diecimila and
/// Uno) seem to work OK with this, and some (Mega) do not always work reliably. Your Mileage May Vary.
/// For best result, use level shifters, or use a RF22 shield or board with level shifters built in, 
/// such as the Sparkfun RFM22 shield http://www.sparkfun.com/products/11018. 
/// You could also use a 3.3V IO Arduino such as a Pro. 
/// It is recognised that it is difficult to connect 
/// the Sparkfun RFM22 shield to a Mega, since the SPI pins on the Mega are different to other Arduinos, 
/// But it is possible, by bending the SPI pins (D10, D11, D12, D13) on the 
/// shield out of the way before plugging it in to the Mega and jumpering the shield pins to the Mega like this:
/// \code
///   RF22 Shield        Mega
///     D10              D53
///     D13              D52
///     D11              D51
///     D12              D50
/// \endcode
/// 
/// \par Interrupts
///
/// The RF22 library uses interrupts to react to events in the RF22 module, 
/// such as the reception of a new packet, or the completion of transmission of a packet. 
/// The RF22 library interrupt service routine reads status from and writes data
/// to the the RF22 module via the SPI interface. It is very important therefore,
/// that if you are using the RF22 library with another SPI based deviced, that you
/// disable interrupts while you transfer data to and from that other device.
/// Use cli() to disable interrupts and sei() to reenable them.
///
/// \par SPI Interface
///
/// The RF22 module uses the SPI bus to communicate with the Arduino. Arduino
/// IDE includes a hardware SPI class to communicate with SPI devices using
/// the SPI facilities built into the Atmel chips, over the standard designated
/// SPI pins MOSI, MISO, SCK, which are usually on Arduino pins 11, 12 and 13
/// respectively (or 51, 50, 52 on a Mega).
///
/// By default, the RF22 library uses the Hardware SPI interface to
/// communicate with the RF22 module. However, if your RF22 SPI is connected to
/// the Arduino through non-standard pins, and the standard Hardware SPI
/// interface will not work for you, you can instead use a bit-banged Software
/// SPI, which can be configured to work on any Arduino digital IO pins. A
/// sample Software SPI class contributed by Chris Lapa is included in the
/// RF22 library, and example sketches showing how to use it are in
/// rf22_client_softwarespi and rf22_server_softwarespi. Thanks Chris!
///
/// The advantages of the Software SPI interface are that it can be used on
/// any Arduino pins, not just the usual dedicated hardware pins. The
/// disadvantage is that it is slightly slower then hardware.
///
/// \par Memory
///
/// The RF22 library requires non-trivial amounts of memory. The sample programs above all compile to 
/// about 9 to 14kbytes each, which will fit in the flash proram memory of most Arduinos. However, 
/// the RAM requirements are more critical. Most sample programs above will run on Duemilanova, 
/// but not on Diecimila. Even on Duemilanova, the RAM requirements are very close to the 
/// available memory of 2kbytes. Therefore, you should be vary sparing with RAM use in programs that use 
/// the RF22 library on Duemilanova.
///
/// The sample RF22Router and RF22Mesh programs compile to about 14kbytes, 
/// and require more RAM than the others. 
/// They will not run on Duemilanova or Diecimila, but will run on Arduino Mega.
///
/// It is often hard to accurately identify when you are hitting RAM limits on Arduino. 
/// The symptoms can include:
/// - Mysterious crashes and restarts
/// - Changes in behaviour when seemingly unrelated changes are made (such as adding print() statements)
/// - Hanging
/// - Output from Serial.print() not appearing
/// 
/// With an Arduino Mega, with 8 kbytes of SRAM, there is much more RAM headroom for 
/// your own elaborate programs. 
/// This library is reported to work with Arduino Pro Mini, but that has not been tested by me.
///
/// The Arduino UNO is now known to work with RF22. 
///
/// \par Automatic Frequency Control (AFC)
///
/// The RF22M modules use an inexpensive crystal to control the frequency synthesizer, and therfore you can expect 
/// the transmitter and receiver frequencies to be subject to the usual inaccuracies of such crystals. The RF22
/// contains an AFC circuit to compensate for differences in transmitter and receiver frequencies. 
/// It does this by altering the receiver frequency during reception by up to the pull-in frequency range. 
/// This RF22 library enables the AFC and by default sets the pull-in frequency range to
/// 0.05MHz, which should be sufficient to handle most situations. However, if you observe unexplained packet losses
/// or failure to operate correctly all the time it may be because your modules have a wider frequency difference, and
/// you may need to set the afcPullInRange to a differentvalue, using setFrequency();
///
/// \par Performance
///
/// Some simple speed performance tests have been conducted.
/// In general packet transmission rate will be limited by the modulation scheme.
/// Also, if your code does any slow operations like Serial printing it will also limit performance. 
/// We disabled any printing in the tests below.
/// We tested with RF22::GFSK_Rb125Fd125, which is probably the fastest scheme available.
/// We tested with a 13 octet message length, over a very short distance of 10cm.
///
/// Transmission (no reply) tests with modulation RF22::GFSK_Rb125Fd125 and a 
/// 13 octet message show about 330 messages per second transmitted.
///
/// Transmit-and-wait-for-a-reply tests with modulation RF22::GFSK_Rb125Fd125 and a 
/// 13 octet message (send and receive) show about 160 round trips per second.
///

/// \par Revision History
///
/// \version 1.0 Initial release
///
/// \version 1.1 Added rf22_snoop and rf22_specan examples
///
/// \version 1.2 Changed default modulation to FSK_Rb2_4Fd36
///              Some internal reorganisation.
///              Added RF22Router and RF22Mesh classes plus sample programs to support multi-hop and 
///              automatic route discovery.
/// \version 1.3 Removed some unnecessary debug messages. Added virtual doArp and isPhysicalAddress
///              functions to RF22Mesh to support other physical address interpretation schemes (IPV4/IPV6?)
/// \version 1.4 RF22Router and RF22Mesh were inadvertently left out of the distro.
/// \version 1.5 Improvements contributed by Peter Mousley: Modem config table is now in flash rather than SRAM, 
///              saving 400 bytes of SRAM. Allow a user-defined buffer size. Thanks Peter.
/// \version 1.6 Fixed some minor typos on doc and clarified that this code is for the RF22B. Fixed errors in the 
///              definition of the power output constants which were incorrectly set to the values for the RF22.
///              Reported by Fred Slamen. If you were using a previous version of RF22, you probably were not getting the output
///              power you thought.
/// \version 1.7 Added code to initialise GPIO0 and GPIO1 so they can automatically control the TX_ANT and RX_ANT
///              antenna switching inputs. You must connect GPIO0 to TX_ANT and GPIO1 to RX_ANT for this automatic 
///              antenna switching to occur. Updated doc to reflect this new connection requirement
/// \version 1.8 Changed the name of RF22_ENLBD in RF22_REG_06_INTERRUPT_ENABLE2 to RF22_ENLBDI because it collided
///              with a define of the same name in RF22_REG_07_OPERATING_MODE. RF22_REG_05_INTERRUPT_ENABLE1 enable mask
///              incorrectly used RF22_IFFERROR instead of RF22_ENFFERR. Reported by Steffan Woltjer.
/// \version 1.9 Fixed typos in RF22_REG_21_CLOCk*. Reported by Steffan Woltjer.
/// \version 1.10 Fixed a problem where a IFFERR during transmission could cause an infinite loop and a hang. 
///              Reported by Raymond Gilbert.
/// \version 1.11 Fixed an innocuous typo in RF22::handleInterrupt. Reported by Zhentao.
///
/// \version 1.12 Improvements to RF22::init from Guy Molinari to improve compatibility with some 
/// Arduinos. Now reported to be working with official Mega 2560 and Uno.
/// Updated so compiles on Arduino 1.0.
///
/// \version 1.13 Announce google support group
///
/// \version 1.14 Added definitions for bits and masks in RF22_REG_1D_AFC_LOOP_GEARSHIFT_OVERRIDE 
/// and RF22_REG_1E_AFC_TIMING_CONTROL  
///
/// \version 1.15 Small alterations to initialisation code so that SS pin is not set to output: may cause 
/// interference with other devices connected to the Arduino. Testing with Uno: OK.
///
/// \version 1.16 Fixed a problem that prevented building with arduino 0021
///
/// \version 1.17 Added optional AFC pull-in frequency range argument to setFrequency(). 
/// Default AFC pull-in range set to 0.05MHz
///
/// \version 1.18 Changed default value for slave slect pin in constructor to be SS, ie the normal one for 
/// the compiled Arduino (D10 for Diecimila, Uno etc and D53 for Mega). This is because some Arduinos such as Mega 2560
/// reportedly use the type of the SS pin to determine whether to run in slave or master mode. Therfore it
/// is preferred that the slave select pin actually be the normal SS pin.
///
/// \version 1.19 Added new mode() function.
///  Fixed a potential race condition in RF22Datagram::recvfrom which might cause corrupt from, to, id or flags
///  under extreme circumstances. Improvements to interrupt hygeine by adding cli()_/sei() around all 
///  RF22 register acceses. Found that 0 length transmit packets confuses the RF22, so they are now forbidden.
///  Added IPGateway example, which routes UDP messages from an internet connection using an 
///  Ethernet Shield and sends them
///  to a radio whose ID is based on the UDP port. Replies are sent back to the originating UDP
///  address and port.
///
///  \version 1.20 _mode is now volatile.
///  RF22::send() now waits until any previous transmission is complete before sending.
///  RF22::waitPacketSent() now waits for the RF22 to not be in _mode == RF22_MODE_TX
///  _txPacketSent member is now redundant and removed.
///  Improvements to interrupt handling and blocking. Now use ATOMIC_BLOCK(ATOMIC_RESTORESTATE)
///  to prevent reenabling interrupts too soon. Thanks to Roland Mieslinger for this suggestion.
///  Added some performance measurements to documentation.
///
///  \version 1.21 Fixed a case where a receiver buffer overflow could occur. Reported by Joe Tuttle.
///
///  \version 1.22 Added documentation after testing with Sparkfun RFM22 Shield DEV-11018.
///                Fixed incorrect link to register calculator excel file, reported by Joey Morin.
///
///  \version 1.23 Added support for alternative SPI interfaces, with default implementation for the standard 
///                Arduino hardware SPI interface. Contributed by Joanna Rutkowska.
///
///  \version 1.24 Fixed a problem that could cause corrupted receive messages if a transmit interrupted
///                a partial receive (as was common with eg ReliableDatagram with poor reception. 
///                Also fixed possible receive buffer overrun.
///  \version 1.25 More rigorous use of const, additional register defines (RF22_CRCHDRS RF22_VARPKLEN)
///                and two methods (setPreambleLength() 
///                and setSyncWords())made public. Patch provided by 
///                Matthijs Kooijman.
///  \version 1.26 Added Cautions about RF22 IO voltages , level shifters and Mega. Include
///                Doxygen documentation in distribution.
///  \version 1.27 Updated author and distribution location details to airspayce.com
///                Added example demodulated data from an actual RF22 transmission assembled 
///                by this RF22 library
///  \version 1.28 Fixed a problem that prevented packets of more than 59 octets being sent properly. 
///                This problem was introduced in a recent update.
///  \version 1.29 Improvements to waitAvailableTimeout to make it robust on millis() rollover. Contributed by

///  \version 1.30 More improvements to timeouts to be robust on millis() rollover. Contributed by 
///                Mats Byggmastar.
///  \version 1.31 Added new function bool waitPacketSent(uint16_t timeout) requested by Benoit Joassart
///  \version 1.32 Can now specify interrupt number 2 in constructor.
///  \version 1.33 Now also compiles for Chipkit Uno32 under mpide-0023. Beta testing only. 
///                Operational reports and testing are welcome.
///  \version 1.34 Added rf22_serial_modem example which implements a transparent
///                serial-radio-serial connection.
///  \version 1.35 Added setCRCPolynomial() to permit alternative CRC polynomials to be used for comptibility with
///                other radio hardware.
///                Fixed a case where noise or certain types of runt packets
///                could cause the RX fifo to get confused, losing the 
///                start point of the next message.
///                Added missing define for RF22_SKIP2PH option for register 30.

///  \version 1.36 Added new modem config FSK_Rb_512Fd4_5 for POCSAG for Kristoff Bonne.
///  \version 1.37 Added SoftwareSPI.h, which is bit-banged software SPI interface class contributed by 
///                by Chris Lapa. Also examples sketches rf22_client_softwarespi.ino and rf22_server_softwarespi.ino
///                showing how to use it.
///  \version 1.38 Chris Lapa corrected some minor errors in SoftwareSPI.h. Thanks Chris.
///  \version 1.39 rf22_serial_modem.ino was accidentally omitted
///  \version 1.40 Added End Of Life notice. This library will no longer be maintained 
///                and updated: use RadioHead instead.

/// \brief Send and receive unaddressed, unreliable datagrams.
///
/// This base class provides basic functions for sending and receiving unaddressed, 
/// unreliable datagrams of arbitrary length to 255 octets per packet.
///
/// Subclasses may use this class to implement reliable, addressed datagrams and streams, 
/// mesh routers, repeaters, translators etc.
///
/// On transmission, the TO and FROM addresses default to 0x00, unless changed by a subclass. 
/// On reception the TO addressed is checked against the node address (defaults to 0x00) or the
/// broadcast address (which is 0xff). The ID and FLAGS are set to 0, and not checked by this class.
/// This permits use of the this base RF22 class as an 
/// unaddresed, unreliable datagram service. Subclasses are expected to change this behaviour to 
/// add node address, ids, retransmission etc
///
/// Naturally, for any 2 radios to communicate that must be configured to use the same frequence and 
/// modulation scheme.
