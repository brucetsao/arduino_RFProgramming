/// \class RF22Router RF22Router.h <RF22Router.h>
/// \brief RF22 subclass for sending addressed, optionally acknowledged datagrams
/// multi-hop routed across a network.
///
/// Extends RF22ReliableDatagram to define addressed messages
/// That are reliably transmitted and routed across a network. Each message is transmitted reliably 
/// between each hop in order to get from the source node to the destination node.
///
/// With RF22Router, routes are hard wired. This means that each node must have programmed 
/// in it how to reach each of the other nodes it will be trying to communicate with. 
/// This means you must specify the next-hop node address for each of the destination nodes, 
/// using the addRouteTo() function. 
///
/// When sendtoWait() is called with a new message to deliver, and the destination address,
/// RF22Router looks up the next hop node for the destination node. It then uses 
/// RF22ReliableDatagram to (reliably) deliver the message to the next hop 
/// (which is expected also to be running an RF22Router). If that next-hop node is not
/// the final destination, it will also look up the next hop for the destination node and 
/// (reliably) deliver the message to the next hop. By this method, messages can be delivered 
/// across a network of nodes, even if each node cannot hear all of the others in the network.
/// Each time a message is received for another node and retransmitted to the next hop, 
/// the HOPS filed in teh header is incremented. If a message is received for routing to another node 
/// which has exceed the routers max_hops, the message wioll be dropped and ignored. 
/// This helps prevent infinite routing loops.
///
/// RF22Router supports messages with a dest of RF22_BROADCAST_ADDRESS. Such messages are not routed, 
/// and are broadcast (once) to all nodes within range.
///
/// The recvfromAck() function is responsible not just for receiving and delivering 
/// messages addressed to this node (or RF22_BROADCAST_ADDRESS), but 
/// it is also responsible for routing other message to their next hop. This means that it is important to 
/// call recvfromAck() or recvfromAckTimeout() frequently in your main loop. recvfromAck() will return 
/// false if it receives a message but it is not for this node.
///
/// RF22Router does not provide reliable end-to-end delivery, but uses reliable hop-to-hop delivery. 
/// If a message is unable to be delivered to an end node during to a delivery failure between 2 hops, 
/// the source node will not be told about it.
///
/// Note: This class is most useful for networks of nodes that are essentially static 
/// (i.e. the nodes dont move around), and for which the 
/// routing never changes. If that is not the case for your proposed network, see RF22Mesh instead.
///
/// \par The Routing Table
///
/// The routing table is a local table in RF22Router that holds the information about the next hop node 
/// address for each destination address you may want to send a message to. It is your responsibility 
/// to make sure every node in an RF22Router network has been configured with a unique address and the 
/// routing information so that messages are correctly routed across the network from source node to 
/// destination node. This is usually done once in setup() by calling addRouteTo(). 
/// The hardwired routing will in general be different on each node, and will depend on the physical 
/// topololgy of the network.
/// You can also use addRouteTo() to change a route and 
/// deleteRouteTo() to delete a route at run time. Youcan also clear the entire routing table
///
/// The Routing Table has limited capacity for entries (defined by RF22_ROUTING_TABLE_SIZE, which is 10)
/// if more than RF22_ROUTING_TABLE_SIZE are added, the oldest (first) one will be removed by calling 
/// retireOldestRoute()
///
/// \par Message Format
///
/// RF22Router add to the lower level RF22ReliableDatagram (and even lower level RF22) class mesage formats. 
/// In those lower level classes, the hop-to-hop message headers are in the RF22 message headers, 
/// and are handled automcatically by tyhe RF22 hardware.
/// RF22Router and its subclasses add an end-to-end addressing header in the payload of the RF22 message, 
/// and before the RF22Router application data.
/// - 1 octet DEST, the destination node address (ie the address of the final 
///   destination node for this message)
/// - 1 octet SOURCE, the source node address (ie the address of the originating node that first sent 
///   the message).
/// - 1 octet HOPS, the number of hops this message has traversed so far.
/// - 1 octet ID, an incrementing message ID for end-to-end message tracking for use by subclasses. 
///   Not used by RF22Router.
/// - 1 octet FLAGS, a bitmask for use by subclasses. Not used by RF22Router.
/// - 0 or more octets DATA, the application payload data. The length of this data is implicit 
///   in the length of the entire message.
///
/// You should be careful to note that there are ID and FLAGS fields in the low level per-hop 
/// message header too. These are used only for hop-to-hop, and in general will be different to 
/// the ones at the RF22Router level.
///
/// \par Testing
///
/// Bench testing of such networks is notoriously difficult, especially simulating limited radio 
/// connectivity between some nodes.
/// To assist testing (both during RF22 development and for your own networks) 
/// RF22Router.cpp has the ability to 
/// simulate a number of different small network topologies. Each simulated network supports 4 nodes with 
/// addresses 1 to 4. It operates by pretending to not hear RF22 messages from certain other nodes.
/// You can enable testing with a \#define TEST_NETWORK in RF22Router.h
/// The sample programs rf22_mesh_* rely on this feature.
///
/// Part of the Arduino RF22 library for operating with HopeRF RF22 compatible transceivers 
/// (see http://www.hoperf.com)
